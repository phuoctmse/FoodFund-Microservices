### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### MICROSERVICES

- Design services around business capabilities rather than technical functions
- Implement API gateways to handle cross-cutting concerns for {{client_types}}
- Use event-driven communication for asynchronous operations between services
- Implement circuit breakers to handle failures gracefully in distributed systems
- Design for eventual consistency in data that spans multiple services
- Implement service discovery and health checks for robust system operation
