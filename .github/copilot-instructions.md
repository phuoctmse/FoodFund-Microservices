# AI Rules for FoodFund Microservices

FoodFund is a digital crowdfunding platform designed to combat food insecurity in developing countries by enabling transparent and efficient food preparation and distribution for communities in need. It connects donors, fund committees, kitchen staff, delivery teams, and admins in a unified system. Donors contribute to verified campaigns, track donations, and view spending reports. Fund committees create campaigns and approve fund withdrawals via a multi-signature process. Kitchen staff manage cooking tasks and submit ingredient/wage proposals, while delivery teams track distributions and redeem digital meal vouchers. Admins oversee users, campaigns, and analytics.

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.


### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### MICROSERVICES

- Design services around business capabilities rather than technical functions
- Implement API gateways to handle cross-cutting concerns for {{client_types}}
- Use event-driven communication for asynchronous operations between services
- Implement circuit breakers to handle failures gracefully in distributed systems
- Design for eventual consistency in data that spans multiple services
- Implement service discovery and health checks for robust system operation


### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code


## BACKEND

### Guidelines for NODE

#### NEST

- Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability following SOLID principles
- Implement custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns to keep code DRY and maintain separation of business logic
- Use interceptors for transforming the response data structure consistently for {{api_standards}}
- Leverage NestJS Guards for authorization to centralize access control logic across {{protected_resources}}
- Implement domain-driven design with modules that encapsulate related functionality and maintain clear boundaries
- Use TypeORM or Mongoose with repository patterns to abstract database operations and simplify testing with mocks


## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

#### POSTGRES

- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
- Implement JSONB columns for semi-structured data instead of creating many tables for {{flexible_data}}
- Use materialized views for complex, frequently accessed read-only data


## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Implement Testing Library for component testing instead of enzyme
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CONTAINERIZATION

#### DOCKER

- Use multi-stage builds to create smaller production images
- Implement layer caching strategies to speed up builds for {{dependency_types}}
- Use non-root users in containers for better security
